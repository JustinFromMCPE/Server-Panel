## Hold up, what's this?
This is a Minecraft server control panel, developed using a combination of PHP, JavaScript and Java. If that doesn't mean anything to you, it's basically a multicraft alternative; you would use it to access and control your server remotely.

# Summary
#### Welcome to my panel, or I guess, *your* panel. This panel was built with [Bootstrap 4](v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com), PHP, Javascript, and Java. That being said, this panel has many cool features (some still in the works!), as well as full mobile support and constant visual updating, for the best look and functionality.
##### Ok, so why don't I use Multicraft?
 Well, here are a couple issues with Multicraft:
 - It costs money
 - Old versions have very limited functionality
 - Old versions look old and lame
 - Lots of class injection
##### Ok, so why should I use your panel?
My panel has many features out of the box, and more coming:
 - It's 100% free!
 - Open source
 - No class injection
 - Modern look and feel
 - Mobile support
 - Easy setup

## Installation

## FAQ
#### What are the requirements for using this?
Well, you need a computer/server to run this, along with your Minecraft server. This means, no hosted Minecraft servers and no website servers. Apart from that, this will run on most platforms, along with the installation of PHP.

#### How does this look on my phone/small device?
The panel was built using Bootstrap 4, so it would be a sin to not include mobile support. If your screen gets too small, the panel will snap to a more versatile layout.

#### Is this compatible with all versions of Minecraft?
This panel uses **no** class injection, which is a unique feature. This means that you can run not just any version of Minecraft, but literally any (theoretically) Java based program.

#### The overview tab isn't working?!?
Make sure that you have `enable-query` set to `true`, in your server.properties file.

#### This is cool and all, but it's pretty basic. Do you plan on adding more?
Of course, I have many things planned, fear not!

#### OMG something doesn't work!!!
Sorry, this panel is still *very* WIP. Create an issue thread, and I'll get to it ASAP.
